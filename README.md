d# 2D_PBC
This is a python abaqus script for generating two dimensional periodic boundary condition in representative volume element.
It is a Abaqus python script for two dimensional composite structure with one matrix and one inclusion component.

This code requires some manual input to assign the section and create the boundary conditions and loading Step. 
It creates the node pairing, creates the set for all the nodes and creates constraint equation. 
This is the coding basis of the youtube vedio by Dr. Micheal Okereke. The link of the specific vedio:
